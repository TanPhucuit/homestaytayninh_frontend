## UI Rules

- Mobile-first layout, then two-column desktop sections.
- Warm editorial cards, soft sand backgrounds, terracotta CTAs.
- Keep booking totals and status chips visually persistent on booking/detail screens.
- Staff/owner/admin screens share the same shell but expose role-specific actions.
- Buttons and form controls use `12px` radius.
- Cards and table containers use `16px` radius.
- Status chips can stay pill-shaped for scanability, but their colors must map back to Terra & Leaf or semantic success/error states.
- Avoid non-token hardcoded brand colors in page components; prefer global classes `card`, `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `field`, and `table-card`.
